<Title main>Sophia, a /webdev/ üåßÔ∏è</Title>

Hey there, I'm Sophia. I'm a 26-years-old normie from South Korea, mainly works with overall /webdev/ techs.
Currently, I'm working as full-time developer.

when I work, I mainly use `react`, `node`, `typescript` but whether if it's about back-end or front-end,
I really love to make my own development environment and component sets.
You can check out my handwritten source codes on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/async3619).

As you can see, as a nerdy workaholic, I use to spend most of my waking time developing.
and now I'm interested in and learning Graphics Development (especially 3D, shading, etc.),
Machine Learning, UI¬∑UX Design.

and I also spend my off-developing time with watching [movies](https://pedia.watcha.com/ko-KR/users/a9L5PYDbYKxwg),
listening [musics](https://www.last.fm/user/async3619). and love to drink, particularly interested in cocktails.
so I'm preparing for a craftsman bartender license.
If you want to know more about whom this nerd is, take a look on my [personal blog](https://blog.sophia-dev.io/).
